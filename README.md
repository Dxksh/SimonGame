About the app:
1. The App features four coloured buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the App.
2. At the start of the first round of a new game, the App generates a random sequence of 10 colour- names, where each represents one of the four buttons. This sequence is not directly shown to the player.
3. Play begins with the App activating the button associated with the first colour-name in the sequence. The player has to then press the button that matches that.
4. For the second round, the App activates in order, buttons associated with the first two colour-names in the sequence. The player must then press buttons to match that sequence.
5. This continues with three and then four, etc., until either all ten items in the sequence have been presented and the player has successfully reproduced the whole sequence, or the player makes a mistake.
6. The player is awarded a number of points that match the length of the sequence that they successfully reproduced. A new sequence five items longer than before is then generated, and play begins again from step 3 above.
7. At the end of the game, when the player fails to repeat the sequence correctly, their overall score is displayed and then stored along with the date in a high-score table.
